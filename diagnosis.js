    description: `Fever occurs when a person's body temperature becomes too hot, indicating a response to various illnesses. While a fever itself is not a sickness, it serves as a sign of an underlying condition. A high fever (over 39°C or 102°F) can be particularly concerning, especially in young children.`,
    solution: `Here are some essential tips for managing fever in children
    1. Encourage your child to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids.
    2. Dress your child in lightweight clothing to keep them comfortable.
    3. Use a light blanket if they feel chilly, until the chills subside.
    4. Avoid giving aspirin to children or teenagers.
    5. For infants, consult a doctor before giving any pain relievers.
    6. If your child is 6 months or older, you can give them acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) following proper dosing instructions.

    Seek immediate medical attention in the following situations:
  
    1. Babies under 3 months old with a fever require urgent medical evaluation.
    2. If a child of any age displays persistent fussiness or unusual behavior, even after taking medication to reduce the fever.
    3. Look for signs of dehydration, such as no wet diapers for over eight to 10 hours, absence of tears while crying, dry mouth, or refusal to drink fluids.
    4. Seek medical help if your child experiences a stiff neck or severe headache.
    5. Pay attention to other symptoms like abdominal pain, difficulty breathing, rash, joint pain, or swelling.
    6. If the fever persists for more than five consecutive days, seek medical advice.

    Always prioritize your child's well-being and consult a healthcare professional if you have any concerns about their fever.
    Managing Fever in Adults

  "choking": {
    description: "When food or something else get stucks in a person’s throat and he cannot breathe well. Choking occurs when an object becomes lodged in the throat or windpipe, obstructing the normal airflow. In adults, food particles are typically responsible for choking incidents, while young children are more prone to choking on small objects. This condition is life-threatening as it deprives the brain of oxygen. It is crucial to administer first aid promptly if you or someone else experiences choking.",
    solution: `Signs of Choking to Look For:

    1. One or both hands clutching the throat.
    2. An expression of panic, shock, or confusion.
    3. Inability to speak.
    4. Strained or noisy breathing.
    5. Squeaky sounds while attempting to breathe.
    6. Coughing, which may be weak or forceful.
    7. Skin, lips, and nails turning blue or gray.
    8. Loss of consciousness.
    
    If the choking person can cough forcefully, allow them to continue coughing, as this might naturally dislodge the obstructing object. However, if the person cannot cough, talk, cry, or laugh forcefully, administer first aid immediately.

    First Aid Steps (Recommended by the American Red Cross):
    
    1. Perform five back blows: Stand to the side and slightly behind the choking adult or kneel behind a child. Place one arm across their chest for support and bend them over at the waist, facing the ground. Strike between the shoulder blades five times using the heel of your hand.
    
    2. Give five abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver): If back blows don't clear the blockage, stand or kneel behind the person and wrap your arms around their waist. Position one hand above their navel, make a fist, and grasp it with your other hand. Apply a quick, upward thrust into their abdomen. For a child, use gentle yet firm pressure to avoid injury.
    
    3. Alternate between five back blows and five abdominal thrusts until the blockage is dislodged.

    
    Note: If you're unable to perform back blows, proceed directly with abdominal thrusts. Both methods are acceptable for adults and children older than one year.
    
    If you're the only rescuer, provide back blows and abdominal thrusts first, then call 911 or your local emergency number for assistance. If someone else is present, ask them to call for help while you administer first aid.
    
    If the person becomes unconscious, initiate standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with chest compressions and rescue breaths.
    
    In cases involving pregnant individuals or when you cannot reach around the stomach, use chest thrusts instead:
    
    1. Position your hands at the base of the breastbone, just above where the lowest ribs meet.
    
    2. Apply a firm and quick thrust, pressing into the chest.
    
    3. Repeat the chest thrusts until the airway is cleared.
    
    To clear the airway of an unconscious person:
    
    1. Lay the person on their back with arms by their sides.
    
    2. Clear the airway by carefully sweeping the mouth with your finger if you can see the object. Avoid finger sweeping if the object is not visible, as this could push it deeper into the airway.
    
    3. If the person remains unresponsive, begin CPR, using chest compressions to dislodge the obstruction. Administer only two rescue breaths per cycle, and regularly check the mouth for the object.
    
    To clear the airway of a choking infant (aged younger than 1):
    
    1. Sit down and hold the infant face-down on your forearm, with their head lower than their trunk.
    
    2. Thump the infant gently but firmly five times on their back, using the heel of your hand and keeping your fingers pointed upward to avoid hitting the back of their head. The combination of gravity and the back thumps should release the blockage.
    
    3. If the infant is not breathing, turn them face-up on your forearm with their head lower than their trunk.
    
    4. Give five gentle but firm chest compressions using two fingers just below the nipple line. Let the chest rise between each compression.
    
    5. Repeat the back thumps and chest compressions if breathing does not resume. Call for emergency medical help.
    
    6. If the airway is clear but the infant is still not breathing, initiate infant CPR.

    
    If you find yourself alone and choking:
    
    1. Call 112 or your local emergency number immediately.
    
    2. Perform abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver) on yourself to dislodge the obstruction:
    
       - Place a fist slightly above your navel.
       - Grasp your fist with your other hand.
       - Bend over a hard surface like a countertop or chair.
       - Shove your fist inward and upward.
    
    Remember, it's crucial to act quickly and confidently when dealing with choking to provide effective first aid. Always seek medical help even if you successfully dislodge the obstruction to ensure the person's well-being.
    If the person still cannot breathe, call emergency line, get the person to the nearest hospital.`,

    description: "A person who has stopped breathing has only 4 minutes to live! You must act fast!",
    solution: `Call 112 If:
    Someone is drowning.
    A child is having problems breathing or has stopped breathing as a result of being immersed or submerged in liquid. (Remember, children can drown in as little as 1 inch of water.)
    A child has had a near-drowning episode
    1. Get Help
    Notify a lifeguard, if one is close. If not, ask someone to call 911.
    If you are alone and you can swim, follow the steps below.
    2. Move the Person
    Take the person out of the water.
    3. Check for Breathing
    Place your ear next to the person's mouth and nose. Do you feel air on your cheek?
    Look to see if the person's chest is moving.
    4. If the Person is Not Breathing, Check Pulse
    Check the person's pulse for 10 seconds.
    5. If There Is No Pulse, Start CPR
    For an adult:
    
    Carefully place the person on their back.
    Place the heel of one hand on the center of the chest at the nipple line. You can also push with one hand on top of the other.
    Press down at least 2 inches. Make sure not to press on ribs.
    Do chest compressions only, at the rate of 100-120 per minute or more. Let the chest rise completely between pushes.
    Check to see if the person has started breathing.
    
    For a child, CPR starts with rescue breathing:
    
    Carefully place the child on their back.
    Tilt head back and lift the chin. For a baby, be careful not to tilt the head back too far.
    With an older child, pinch the nose closed and put your mouth over the child's mouth, forming a tight seal. With an infant, place your mouth over both the baby's nose and mouth.
    Blow into the child's mouth for 1 second. You should see their chest rise.
    Repeat the breath a second time.
    Then begin chest compressions:
    
    For a child, place the heel of one hand on the center of the chest at the nipple line. For an infant, place two fingers on the breastbone.
    Press down at least 2 inches for a child, about 1 and 1/2 inches for an infant. Make sure not to press on the ribs or the end of the breastbone.
    Do 30 chest compressions, at the rate of 100 per minute. Let the chest rise completely between pushes.
    Check to see if the child has started breathing.
    If you’re alone, take a break to call 112 after 2 minutes of CPR.
    Repeat if Person Is Still Not Breathing
    If you've been trained in CPR, you can now add two rescue breaths to the adult CPR cycle. Open the airway by tilting the head back and lifting the chin.
    Pinch the nose of the victim closed. Take a normal breath, cover the victim's mouth with yours to create an airtight seal, and then give 2 one-second breaths as you watch for the chest to rise.
    Give two breaths followed by 30 chest compressions.
    Continue the cycle of 30 compressions and two breaths until the person starts breathing or emergency help arrives.
    Note that these instructions are not meant to replace CPR training. Classes are available through the Nigerian Red Cross, local hospitals, you can also watch proper emergencies.`,

 "nosebleed": {
    description: "How to stop nose bleeds.",
    solution: `1. Sit quietly and upright.
    2. Blow the nose gently to remove mucus and blood.
    3. Have the person pinch the nose firmly for 10 minutes or until the bleeding has stopped.If this does not control the bleeding .Pack the nostril with a wad of cotton, leaving part of it outside the nose. 
    If possible, first wet the cotton with Vaseline or lidocaine, then pinch the nose firmly again. Do not let go for 10 minutes or more. Do not tip the head back.
    Leave the cotton in place for a few hours after the bleeding stops; then take it out very carefully.`,
